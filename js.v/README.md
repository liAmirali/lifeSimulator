# lifeSimulator
This is a Javascript zero-player game that simulates our lives.

## How to run
To run this pseudo-life game, download the files and open index.html in your browser. Then open the Console (by Ctrl+Shift+k in Firefox and Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome). There you can see what happens to the people.

## Things you see in this world
world (array): This is the main thing! The world where humans live!

person (object): My humans are treated like objects! :D They have the following properties:
1) strength: It defines how physically strong a person is. It's good to be strong if rich and stingy people are annoying you or you may live longer during starvation ;).
2) generousness: This specifies how generous a person is. This can be about giving money or food to others.
3) food: The amount of food each person has.
4) gluttony: This specifies how much a person praises his stomach. 0.99 shows no one can be alive from him and 0.01 is being so convinced!
5) money: The amount of money each person has. Anyone needs to buy food!

neighbor: Someone's neighbor is the person whose index is one more than the person himself. For example, person \#2 is the person \#1's neighbor. Note that the last person's neighbor is the person \#0.

# Philosophy Time
Hey. I'm Amirali, a math student who loves programming. I created this pseudo-life game and added some pseudo-humans into that world. Am I a God now?<br><br>
The idea of this game came to my mind on a normal day during some philosophical thoughts. I was thinking about the existence of us and the reason of it.<br>
George Berkeley said that all the things we see or feel are created by God, we are actually the spirit of him. He also doubted the absolute and independent existence of time and space. He said that our experience of time and space may just be an illusion.<br>
And then I said what about being some bits! Our existence may just be some computer processes. Think about the things you do in a day; you wake up, shower, eat breakfast, dress up, head to work, interacting with people, and on and on. These things you do in a day are just some predefined functions.<br>
We treat like a bunch of if-else statements. If you felt hungry, then eat food! Or if you're out of money, go to work! That's what 600-BC philosophers were looking for, the causality!<br>
Our behavior is based on our personality, right? What are our personalities? What are they in a code? Well, they can be a lot of complicated key-value pairs in the defined object of us. The key-value pairs can be passed into functions and return some result and that's how we behave in different situations.<br>
## Creatures and Logic (and Programming!)
Have you ever thought about how our body organs work? Do they just do everything unconsciously? Or they are based on logic?
Well, I say logics! Nothing in this world improvises (Unless they are programmed to!). They are all about logic and causality. I don't know much about biology and stuff but I am sure that my heart doesn't just beat on its own! Something is making it beat. Brain? Maybe. But what about the brain itself? Does it do its things on its own? No. There must be a cause!<br>
So after this long introduction here comes the programming: The causes are the damn commands! Our brains may send some commands to our organs to work. I mean programmatic command! Like there are a lot of bash scripts that the brain (like the CPU in a computer) sends to organs and make them do something. And the user is God! (Like you when you're playing this game, lifeSimulator). Anyway, you may have not fetched(!) the data I was trying to send, but think about how logical every cell, every single atom is treating! We just don't understand it because of its complexity.

## Gods Competition
Another absurdist side-theory about this philosophy is God Competition. It says there are some Gods (programmers) who are competing with each other about writing a very smart program in which some creatures are living and growing until the death. The winner is the God whom his creatures are the first ones who discover that their existence is nothing else than a bunch of ones and zeros. Wish our God luck!


## Movies and TV Shows About This Philosophy
### 1) Rick and Morty Season 1 Episode 4
In this episode, almost everything is simulated by some aliens named Zigerions (who act like the Programmer God in this philosophy) to gain the concentrated dark matter.

A part of the script after Rick took Morty out of the class by force:<br>
Rick: Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.<br>
Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?<br>
Rick: It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.<br>

## End of Philosophy Time
I may add more things to this Philosophy Time section over time. Be more thoughtful about this. This complicated thing we are living in may just be a thought, or a code snippet, or illusion, or a game, nobody knows...
