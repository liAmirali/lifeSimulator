# lifeSimulator
This is a Javascript zero-player game which simulates our lives.

## How to run
To run this pseudo-life game, download the files and open index.html in your browser. Then open the Console (by Ctrl+Shift+k in Firefox and Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome). There you can see what happens to the people.

## Things you see in this world
world (array): This is the main thing! The world where humans live!<br><br>
person (object): My humans are treated as objects! :D They have the following peroperties:
1) strength: It defines how physically strong a person is. It's good to be strong if rich and stingy people are annoying you or you may live longer during starvation ;).
2) generousness: This specifies how generous a person is. This can be about giving money or food to others.
3) food: The amount of food each person has.
4) gluttony: This specifies how much a person praise his stomach. 0.99 shows no one can be alive from him and 0.01 is being so convinced!
5) money: The amount of money each person has. Anyone needs to buy food!

# Philosophy Time
Hey. I'm Amirali, a math student who lives programming. I created this pseudo-life game and added some pseudo-humans into that world. Am I a God now?<br><br>
The idea of this game came to my mind in a normal day during some philosophical thoughts. I was thinking about existence of us and the reason of it.<br>
George Berkeley said that all the things we see or feel are created by God, we are actually the spirit of him. He also doubted in the absolute and independent existence of time and space. He said that our experience of time and space may just be an illusion.<br>
And then I said what about being some bits! Our existence may just be some computer processes. Think about the things you do in a day; you wake up, shower, eat breakfast, dress up, head to work, interacting with people and on and on. These things you do in a day are just some pre-defined functions.<br>
We treat like a bunch of if else statements. If you felt hungry, then eat food! Or if you're out of money, go to work! That's what 600-BC philosophers were looking for, the causality!<br>
Our behavior are based on our personality, right? What are our personalities? What are they in a code? Well, they can be a lot of complicated key-value pairs in the defined object of us. The key-value pairs can be passed into functions and return some result and that's how we behave in different situations.
