# lifeSimulator
This is a Javascript zero-player game which simulates our lives.

## How to run
To run this pseudo-life game, download the files and open index.html in your browser. Then open the Console (by Ctrl+Shift+k in Firefox and Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome). There you can see what happens to the people.

## Scenario
This game intends to show how stupid and easy how lives are, and maybe we are all some objects in an array which do some specific functions at a day.

## Things you see in this world
world: This is the actual world we are living in, an array!
person/people: Person is actually an object which has some property(key) and some value.
Current properties are:
1) attraction: This specifies how attractive a person is. This can affect their relation with other people or something that I don't know yet :).
2) generousness: This specifies how generous a person is. This can be about giving money or food to others.
3) food: The amount of food each person has.
4) gluttony: This specifies how much a person praise his stomach. 100 shows no one can be alive from him and 0 is being so convinced!
5) money: the amount of money each person has.
