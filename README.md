# lifeSimulator
This is a Javascript zero-player game which simulates our lives.

## How to run
To run this psuedo-life, downoad the files and open index.html in your browser. Then open the Console (by Ctrl+Shift+k in firefox). There you can see what happens to the people.

##Scenario
This game intends to show how stupid and easy how lives are, and maybe we are all some objects in an array which do some specific functions at a day.

#Things you see in this world
world: This is the actual world we are living in, an array!
person/people: Person is actually an object which has some property(key) and some value.
Current properties are:
1) id: This specifies everyone's place in world. (Same as world[index] does).
2) gender: This specifies a person's gender. This can be either "Yam" or "Mal".
3) attraction: This specifies how attractive a person is. This can affect their relation with other people or something that I don't know yet :).
4) generousness: This specifies how generous a person is. This can be about giving money or food to others.
5) food: The amount of food each person has.
6) hunger: This specifies how much hungry a person is. 100 shows no hunger and 0 is about being dead!
7) money: the amount of money each person has.
