# lifeSimulator
## Overview
This program is a pseudo-life zero-player game written in both JavaScript and Python (two separate versions!).
This game wants to show you how our lives can be just a simulation.
It's just an idea. Think how more complicated and detailed programs can be more closer and resemblant to our lives ;)
